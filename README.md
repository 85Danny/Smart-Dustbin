A Smart Dustbin Project.
In this project, two ultrasonic sensors were used to measure the depth of a dustbin 
and the distance between a person and the bin.
When certain conditions are met, the lid of the bin will open automatically
and close automatically, and sometimes, it will not even open when the bin is full.
